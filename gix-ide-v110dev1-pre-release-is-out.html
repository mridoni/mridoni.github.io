While the "standard" debugger <strong>is</strong> the one to be currently used, having a single and published version will help speed up the development process.</p><p>This pre-release also arrives with new binary packages: compiler and runtime files have been moved outside the installer itself and will be downloaded on-demand. While this means that an Internet connection is needed to install Gix-IDE <em>with</em> a compiler, it makes the installer a lot smaller and more easily upgradable. As a consequence, there are no more "no-compilers" packages, you just will just have to skip installing the compiler(s) when running the installer.</p><p>Moreover, the Windows binary packages have been signed with my code-signing certificate, for an added level of trust.</p><p>There is a brand-new package for Ubuntu 22.04, that should avoid the compatibility hacks that were needed for the previous package (aimed at 20.04). Debian-specific packages will follow as soon as possible.</p><p>Beware: this pre-release is to be considered of "beta quality": there are probably a few bugs - both in packaging and in the code itself - that have to be shaken down, and a few known issues (see below), but as development is gaining some traction, I really needed to streamline the process, and this (pre-)release is a step in that direction.</p><p>Another point of attention is the fact that the new packages are being built with GitHub Actions: the building and packaging process is entirely reproducible using the workflows supplied in this repository. This also means that - internally - development has been moved almost entirely from a SVN-based setup to Git/GitHub: some long-term work will still take place internally (at first), but updates on GitHub will be quicker and more frequent.</p><p>All of the above (building, packaging, etc.), starting from the next release, will also apply to GixSQL, for which I am doing some planning/research and hope to have a timeframe really soon.</p><p>The packages are signed with my GPG private key. The corresponding public key (<a href="mailto:m.ridoni@gmail.com">m.ridoni@gmail.com</a>, fingerprint 70E4 08CF B89B 5FA8 32E4 5292 EFDC 94BD 5260 B939) has been published on pgp.mit.edu and keyserver.ubuntu.com and is available at <a href="https://github.com/mridoni.gpg">https://github.com/mridoni.gpg</a></p><p>Binary packages available</p><ul><li>Windows x86</li><li>Windows x64</li><li>Linux x64 (Ubuntu 20.04LTS)</li><li>Linux x64 (Ubuntu 22.04LTS)</li></ul><p>A summary of new features and fixes:</p><ul><li>Integrated "standalone" debugger (still not completely functional)</li><li>Enabled rectangular selection in the editor</li><li>Added tooltips for COBOL variables in the editor with variable information (the content of a variable is also displayed when debugging)</li><li>ESQL blocks are now automatically skipped when debugging (the debugger stops on the first line of the block, then "jumps" after the END-EXEC clause when stepping</li><li>Added new icons (including for file types used by Gix-IDE)</li><li>Linux build and debugger fixes</li></ul><p>Known bugs and issues</p><ul><li>The standalone debugger is present but still not functional.
