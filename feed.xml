This release fixes an important bug in the Linux debugger in Gix-IDE, but for the most part is heavily focused on improvements to GixSQL (thanks to Simon Sobisch for pointing out things that could - and in many cases needed - to be improved). Among the improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>New (and way neater) format for the connection string, with the possibility of passing options to the backend "drivers"</li>
<li>Multiple connections are now supported (CONNECT...AS, EXEC SQL AT...)</li>
<li>VARCHAR/VARBINARY fields are now directly supported in the COBOL source, without the need to manually define "level-49" fields. Both EXEC SQL VAR... and "SQL TYPE IS" declarations are supported</li>
<li>Improved error handling and general robustness both in the preprocessor and in the runtime library</li>
<li>Improved memory allocation</li>
<li>A source package (.tar.gz) will be made available, to be compiled on Linux with autoconf/automake, without having to download the full-blown IDE</li>
</ul>
<p>As said above, it's almost done, I just need to f<span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">inish testing, r</span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">evise the packaging scripts and a</span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">dd/edit the documentation.</span></p>

<p dir="auto">llxvm is based on <a href="https://github.com/davidar/lljvm">lljvm</a> by David a. Roberts, a project that unfortunately has been dormant for several years and relies on a now archaic version of LLVM/clang (2.7). I made several changes to adapt it to a more modern version of LLVM/clang (10+), removed some unnecessary tools, rewrote and expanded the linker and added other tools. Moreover, I refactored the backend's code to be able to emit CIL/.Net assembly beside JVM bytecode).</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently <code>llxvm</code> is able to build and run several programs and libraries: as an example libgmp, vbisam and GnuCOBOL's libcob library have been successfully compiled and run, though with some caveats (see "<a href="https://github.com/mridoni/llxvm/blob/main/notes_code_size">Notes about code size</a>" below).</p>
