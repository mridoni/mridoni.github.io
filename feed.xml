<p>The debug clients (including obviously Gix-IDE) will connect using a standard client library, and it will be possible to write a client from scratch or incorporate the debug client library into existing tools (I am writing a minimal text-based client to simplify testing the library).</p>

                    In the last few weeks I have been working on two new DB drivers for GixSQL. The first is an Oracle driver, based on ODPI. The second driver targets SQLite v3. Both drivers are fully functional and have passed the current test suite on x86 and x64 platforms. In the next days/weeks I have the intention of bringing up to speed the MySQL and ODBC drivers, that still lack some functionality (e.g. prepared statement support).

                <p>In the last few weeks I have been working on two new DB drivers for GixSQL.</p>
<p>The first is an Oracle driver, based on <a href="https://oracle.github.io/odpi/">ODPI</a>. The second driver targets SQLite v3. Both drivers are fully functional and have passed the current test suite on x86 and x64 platforms.</p>
<p>In the next days/weeks I have the intention of bringing up to speed the MySQL and ODBC drivers, that still lack some functionality (e.g. prepared statement support). A lot has changed, including in the preprocessor , so when the new version of GixSQL will be out preprocessing and compiling your software again will be a mandatory step.</p>
<p>All this work was also useful to perform a sort of "shakedown" of the codebase: several bugs were located and resolved (notably in COMP-3 handling, that could break on platforms other than PostgreSQL). </p>
<p>I also rewrote the test suite: now there is a "dynamic driver" - still using MSTest - that automatically generates individual test cases from an XML file. This allows me to write a single test case and then run it with different database drivers and on different platforms (Windows only, for now, but who knows? :-) )</p>
<p>There is of course a bunch of issues already opened on GitHub that have been solved and will be in the next release too.</p>
<p>If all goes well the release date will be someday in late August, first days of September at most (still have to prepare the Linux/autoconf build scripts for the new drivers and test there), at least for a prerelease.</p>

                <p>This is a maintenance <strong>pre-release</strong> for GixSQL, that fixes a couple of more urgent issues. Only an "autoconf-enabled" package is part of the release.</p>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solved a problem in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1314568084" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/91" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/mridoni/gixsql/issues/91/hovercard" href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/91">#91</a> (string constants with single/double quotes are now parsed and emitted correctly)</li>
<li>Solved a problem in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1295941001" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/88" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/mridoni/gixsql/issues/88/hovercard" href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/88">#88</a> ("smart" cursor initialization is now performed correctly)</li>
<li>Solved <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1315035427" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/93" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/mridoni/gixsql/issues/93/hovercard" href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/93">#93</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"smart" cursor initialization is now the default. The <code>-L</code> switch now <em>disables</em> smart cursor initialization, while its long form has been changed to <code>no-smart-cursor-init</code></li>
<li>There have been changes in the preprocessing engine, so source code compiled with older versions has to be recompiled. If you are updating directly from v1.0.16 or previous versions, be sure you are using the new runtime libraries (i.e libgixsql/libgixsql-*) due to some breaking changes introduced in v1.0.17.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>An autoconf-enabled source package is <a href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/releases/tag/v1.0.18dev1">available on the (pre)release page</a> at GitHub</p>
