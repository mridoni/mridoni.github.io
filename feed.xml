This will be the first one to undergo automated testing, a change that was necessary, given that the different combinations the IDE can work under (e.g. with MSVC or MinGW compilers, with/without ESQL, x86/x64, etc.) were simply too numerous to continue to test manually and avoid regressions. The 144 tests that I have developed so far - <span style="font-size: 18.4px; color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">rather obviously - </span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">do not aim to reach complete coverage but represent a well-known set of common scenarios like "build and run" for different platforms and environments. Debugging is also being tested, with breakpoints and variable inspection being checked. More tests will be added in the future.</span></p>
<p>Some technical notes: the tests are currently Windows-only: unfortunately a lot of stuff, when testing the UI, is platform specific (Windows vs X11, Qt notwithstanding) and while I'd like to put together something to test on Linux, simply I don't have enough time or resources. The tests (whose code you will find in the upcoming source release) are written in C#, using MSTest  and <a href="https://github.com/FlaUI/FlaUI" title="FlaUI on GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlaUI</a> instead of C++ because, well, it was just far easier and faster to develop them this way and being able to run them in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>The testing framework uses a helper module (testhlpr.dll), that is loaded by the IDE when it starts (only if a given environment variable is set and if the DLL is present in the PATH) and opens a server connection to expose some internals of the IDE to be used in the testing process. This is unfortunately needed because Qt does not expose many properties of the native widgets it creates in a way suitable to testing (i.e. no Automation IDs) and on the other hand it doesn't allow for easy inspection of its custom-drawn widgets from a testing framework. Yes, there are Qt testing frameworks that - supposedly - do this and do it very well, but at cost that for a project like this is simply insane. Given my (and I suppose anyone else's) dislike for applications that open unwanted network connections, testhlpr.dll will not be shipped in the binary packages while its source, as usual, will be available in the source tree.</p>
<p>Packages for Gix-IDE 1.0.7 should be available around the next weekend.</p>

                <h3><strong>Gix-IDE (and more): next steps</strong></h3>
<p>I decided to start these pages (well, there's only one at the moment, but you never know) to provide some feedback on what I am working on in Gix-IDE and in other software projects (some related, others not) that I will be releasing in a few weeks.</p>
<p>I deemed this necessary (or at least useful) because Gix-IDE is currently updated once in a while, basically when I think a release is ready, or due, and I wanted to fill the gap between one release and the other, and let people know that, well, I am still working on it or that, when duty (my day-job) calls, you'll have to be patient.</p>
<p>The next release (1.0.7) is almost ready, as you can read in <a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-107-is-coming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another post</a>. After that I will restart the work I began a couple of months ago and that involves a complete refactoring of the debugger. The debugger will be a separate module (actually two, at least on Windows, for x64 and x86) and the IDE will communicate with it through a well-defined protocol, that I intend to document (time-constraints permitting, of course). This will have important consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>On Windows (and possibly on Linux) it will be possible to debug programs for a different (but obviously supported) architecture: in practice this means that on x64 Windows you will be able to debug both x64 and x86 programs from either version of the IDE, while at the moment you can only debug programs compiled for your host architecture (actually the architecture Gix-IDE was compiled for).</li>
<li>It will be possible to have remote debugging and it will be easier to implement an "attach and debug" feature</li>
<li>It will be possible to use the debugger to develop your own debugging client</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not promising that all these features will be present in the first major release (it will probably be named 1.1.x) but this is definitely the road ahead.</p>
