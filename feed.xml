                <p><br>I am back and I am continuing to review and modify the build process, a few packaging/build related issues should be solved as soon as the next release is out. Due to work-related constraints I cannot give (for now) a solid timeframe, but I hope to have a pre-release in a couple of weeks, maybe a partial one earlier.</p>
<p>The goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release a version that contains the new ("experimental") debugger but also ships the "standard" one, that will be the </li>
<li>Release a packaged version for Windows from the new build system (using GitHub actions)</li>
<li>Include, where possible/desired, versions of GnuCOBOL built with a standard process (also using GitHub actions)</li>
<li>Release new Linux packages for different distributions (at least Ubuntu 20.04 + 22, Debian 10 + 11, possibly Fedora 35/36) </li>
<li>The point above implies using the distribution-provided version of Qt. Since this, on a few distributions, includes Qt 6, the next logical step will be moving the primary target to Qt 6 and leaving Qt 5 - if possible - as a secondary option for older platforms. Obviously this will take some time.<br><br>Sorry for the delays but integrating the new debugger into Gix-IDE is/was a long process that needed a break in the development/release, since too many things changed to perform a clean merge between the two versions and maintaining them separate and up-to-date was simply too much work. After the obstacles above are cleared, development should proceed in a quicker way.<br><br><br></li>

                <p>I am taking a brief pause (i.e. vacation) in the next couple of weeks but I didn't want to leave before giving a few notes about the next steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new debugger for Gix-IDE is at the point where it can be integrated into the main branch. The next version will have the possibility to choose between the current (named "standard") debugger and the "experimental" one. At first I thought of shipping the two versions in parallel for some time, but this proved unfeasible: too many things changed between the two versions of Gix-IDE and keeping them in sync - for stuff that is not debugger-related - is simply too much work. Of course this "fusion" (it's the internal name of the branch I am working on) in turn led to a lot of changes that need to be tested, together with several changes in building and packaging. This means that the "fusion" pre-release will have to wait a few weeks, until I am satisfied that the standard debugger keeps working as it should, but from that moment on, adding features and fixing things should be much easier.</li>
<li>I am switching the building and packaging process for binary packages to GitHub Actions. It will also take some time for the new release pipeline to reach a certain level of stability and to abandon the old process, but this will make releasing new and "ad interim" versions easier and quicker, and also more reproducible, especially for Windows builds.</li>
<li>GixSQL development will advance in two main directions: 1) the "autocommit" feature needs to be reviewed and (probably) fixed for all drivers. 2) updatable cursor support needs to be improved (or, in some cases/drivers, implemented). There is also space for making progress in areas like memory usage, logging, automated testing, refactoring, etc. and, of course, for the usual amount of bug-fixing and parser modifications (thanks, as usual, to Simon Sobisch, whose support has been invaluable).</li>
</ul>
<p>See you soon.</p>

<p>The debug clients (including obviously Gix-IDE) will connect using a standard client library, and it will be possible to write a client from scratch or incorporate the debug client library into existing tools (I am writing a minimal text-based client to simplify testing the library).</p>

                    In the last few weeks I have been working on two new DB drivers for GixSQL. The first is an Oracle driver, based on ODPI. The second driver targets SQLite v3. Both drivers are fully functional and have passed the current test suite on x86 and x64 platforms. In the next days/weeks I have the intention of bringing up to speed the MySQL and ODBC drivers, that still lack some functionality (e.g. prepared statement support).

                <p>In the last few weeks I have been working on two new DB drivers for GixSQL.</p>
<p>The first is an Oracle driver, based on <a href="https://oracle.github.io/odpi/">ODPI</a>. The second driver targets SQLite v3. Both drivers are fully functional and have passed the current test suite on x86 and x64 platforms.</p>
<p>In the next days/weeks I have the intention of bringing up to speed the MySQL and ODBC drivers, that still lack some functionality (e.g. prepared statement support). A lot has changed, including in the preprocessor , so when the new version of GixSQL will be out preprocessing and compiling your software again will be a mandatory step.</p>
<p>All this work was also useful to perform a sort of "shakedown" of the codebase: several bugs were located and resolved (notably in COMP-3 handling, that could break on platforms other than PostgreSQL). </p>
<p>I also rewrote the test suite: now there is a "dynamic driver" - still using MSTest - that automatically generates individual test cases from an XML file. This allows me to write a single test case and then run it with different database drivers and on different platforms (Windows only, for now, but who knows? :-) )</p>
<p>There is of course a bunch of issues already opened on GitHub that have been solved and will be in the next release too.</p>
<p>If all goes well the release date will be someday in late August, first days of September at most (still have to prepare the Linux/autoconf build scripts for the new drivers and test there), at least for a prerelease.</p>

                <p>This is a maintenance <strong>pre-release</strong> for GixSQL, that fixes a couple of more urgent issues. Only an "autoconf-enabled" package is part of the release.</p>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solved a problem in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1314568084" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/91" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/mridoni/gixsql/issues/91/hovercard" href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/91">#91</a> (string constants with single/double quotes are now parsed and emitted correctly)</li>
<li>Solved a problem in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1295941001" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/88" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/mridoni/gixsql/issues/88/hovercard" href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/88">#88</a> ("smart" cursor initialization is now performed correctly)</li>
<li>Solved <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1315035427" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/93" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/mridoni/gixsql/issues/93/hovercard" href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/issues/93">#93</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"smart" cursor initialization is now the default. The <code>-L</code> switch now <em>disables</em> smart cursor initialization, while its long form has been changed to <code>no-smart-cursor-init</code></li>
<li>There have been changes in the preprocessing engine, so source code compiled with older versions has to be recompiled. If you are updating directly from v1.0.16 or previous versions, be sure you are using the new runtime libraries (i.e libgixsql/libgixsql-*) due to some breaking changes introduced in v1.0.17.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>An autoconf-enabled source package is <a href="https://github.com/mridoni/gixsql/releases/tag/v1.0.18dev1">available on the (pre)release page</a> at GitHub</p>
