Since this, on a few distributions, includes Qt 6, the next logical step will be moving the primary target to Qt 6 and leaving Qt 5 - if possible - as a secondary option for older platforms. Obviously this will take some time.<br><br>Sorry for the delays but integrating the new debugger into Gix-IDE is/was a long process that needed a break in the development/release, since too many things changed to perform a clean merge between the two versions and maintaining them separate and up-to-date was simply too much work. After the obstacles above are cleared, development should proceed in a quicker way.<br><br><br></li></ul></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 11, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fmid-october-update.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fmid-october-update.html&amp;via=%40quasicomese&amp;text=Mid-October%20update" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fmid-october-update.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span></a></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://mridoni.github.io/what-is-coming-for-gix-ide-and-gixsql.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> What is coming for Gix-IDE and GixSQL</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
