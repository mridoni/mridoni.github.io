While the "standard" debugger is still the one to be currently used, having a single and published version will help speed up the development process.</p><p>This release also arrives with new binary packages: compiler and runtime files have been moved outside the installer itself and will be downloaded on-demand. While this means that an Internet connection is needed to install Gix-IDE with a compiler, it makes the installer a lot smaller and more easily upgradable. As a consequence, there are no more "no-compilers" packages, you just will just have to skip installing the compiler(s) when running the installer.</p><p>Moreover, the Windows binary installers have been signed with my code-signing certificate, for an added level of trust.</p><p>There is a brand-new package for Ubuntu 22.04, that should avoid the compatibility hacks that were needed for the previous package (aimed at 20.04). Debian-specific packages will follow as soon as possible.</p><p>Since this is the first release of a new cycle (a so-called ".0") there are probably a few bugs - both in packaging and in the code itself - that have to be shaken down, and a few known issues (see below), but as development is gaining some traction, I really needed to streamline the process, and this release is a step in that (hopefully right) direction.</p><p>Another point of attention is the fact that the new packages are being built with GitHub Actions: the building and packaging process is entirely reproducible using the workflows supplied in this repository. This also means that - internally - development has been moved entirely from a SVN-based setup to Git/GitHub: some long-term work will still take place internally (at first), but updates on GitHub will be quicker and more frequent.</p><p>All of the above (building, packaging, etc.), starting from the next release (v1.0.19), also apply to GixSQL, for which I am doing some planning/research and hope to have a more accurate timeframe really soon.</p><p>By the way: I have added a new e-mail address to my key because I started to sign the binary installers with a code signing certificate, and it just seemed "prettier" to use for the e-mail contact a domain that I own instead of a generic GMail address.</p><p>Binary packages available</p><ul><li>Windows x86</li><li>Windows x64</li><li>Linux x64 (Ubuntu 20.04LTS)</li><li>Linux x64 (Ubuntu 22.04LTS)</li></ul><p>A summary of new features and fixes:</p><ul><li>Integrated "standalone" debugger (still not completely functional)</li><li>Enabled rectangular selection in the editor</li><li>Added tooltips for COBOL variables in the editor with variable information (the content of a variable is also displayed when debugging)</li><li>ESQL blocks are now automatically skipped when debugging (the debugger stops on the first line of the block, then "jumps" after the END-EXEC clause when stepping</li><li>Added new icons (including for file types used by Gix-IDE)</li><li>Linux build and debugger fixes</li></ul><p>Known bugs and issues</p><ul><li>The standalone debugger is present but it is still a work in progress, so some things might not work as expected (e.g. debugging when using a MinGW-based compiler on Windows). The debugger version can be selected under Settings -&gt; Debug</li><li>When debugging on Windows, a "stray" console window appear, this is probably from some logging artifact</li></ul><p>Available, as usual, on the <a href="https://github.com/mridoni/gix/releases/tag/v1.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release page</a> on GitHub.</p><p><a href="https://paypal.me/mridoni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donations </a>or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/mridoni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsors</a> are welcome.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 7, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fgix-ide-110-is-available.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fgix-ide-110-is-available.html&amp;via=%40quasicomese&amp;text=Gix-IDE%201.1.0%20is%20available" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fgix-ide-110-is-available.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span></a></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gixsql-1019-is-out.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> GixSQL 1.0.19 is out</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-early-december-update.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Gix-IDE: December update </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-02-22T16:20" class="feed__date">February 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-and-gixsql-v108-are-out.html" class="invert">Gix-IDE and GixSQL v1.0.8 are out</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-02-19T09:57" class="feed__date">February 19, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-and-gixsql-108-are-coming.html" class="invert">Gix-IDE and GixSQL 1.0.8 are coming</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-16T11:39" class="feed__date">January 16, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-v107-is-out.html" class="invert">Gix-IDE v1.0.7 is out</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
