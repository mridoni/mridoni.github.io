This allows me to write a single test case and then run it with different database drivers and on different platforms (Windows only, for now, but who knows? :-) )</p>\n<p>There is of course a bunch of issues already opened on GitHub that have been solved and will be in the next release too.</p>\n<p>If all goes well the release date will be someday in late August, first days of September at most (still have to prepare the Linux/autoconf build scripts for the new drivers and test there), at least for a prerelease.</p>\n<p>Â </p>",
