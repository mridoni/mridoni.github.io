When double-clicking an error message, the editor will switch to the file and line indicated.</li>\n<li>The output window was split into different panes (\"IDE\", \"Build\" and \"Debug\", for now) so that the output of different subsystem can be routed in a proper way and be less confusing. This should fix issue #113 and #126, or at least be a rather big step in that direction.</li>\n<li>The logging system in the IDE is now based on <a href=\"https://github.com/gabime/spdlog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spdlog</a>, QLogger usage is confined (for now) to <code>gix-http</code>.</li>\n<li>Metadata management has been fixed and made faster.</li>\n<li>The build system received a few fixes. Multi-binary projects now work correctly (this should also solve #112).</li>\n<li>Filename tooltips have been added to the editor tabs</li>\n<li>Files can now be also dragged onto project folders, not just on the projects themselves</li>\n<li>The Windows installers do not need administrative rights anymore. If a non-administrative user chooses to install a MSVC-based version of GnuCOBOL, a warning will be displayed (Visual Studio 2022 C++ Build Tools need administrative rights to be installed, no way around that). The user can choose whether to go back or to continue. If the latter option is chosen, the customary rights elevation prompt will be displayed when trying to install the Visual Studio 2022 C++ Build Tools.</li>\n<li>Fixed ESQL parameter-style setting in the IDE (now it is possible to set the corect parameter style/prefix).</li>\n<li>Added an option in the IDE that maps to GixSQL's \"consolidate source\" (i.e. stitch all module sources/COPY files together before preprocessing). This is needed in some scenarios to properly parse metadata.</li>\n<li>Fixed a possible crash in the logging system</li>\n<li><code>gix-http </code>was inadvertently deactivated in the build configuration, now it is built again by default</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Known bugs and issues</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new Output/Error windows still have some small quirks (some messages not being displayed, UI glitches, etc.). I hope to solve them before the release, but since the new logging/output system is a massive improvement over the older one and the way to go, it will be shipped anyway.</li>\n<li>I still have not decided whether to install \"in place\" the MSVC runtime files for GixSQL runtime libraries. While not a big issue for the GixSQL version shipped with Gix-IDE, this might have an adverse effect on production systems where an updated MSVC runtime is available and regularly updated at system level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this will be part of a v1.1.1 release that should be available after the necessary testing phase, probably in a week or two, surely before the Christmas holidays.</p>\n<p>As usual, <a href=\"https://paypal.me/mridoni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">donations </a>or <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/mridoni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sponsors</a> are welcome.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Both of them have been there since the first releases, but due to several reasons (essentially lack of usage and bad assumptions) they were left behind and their functionality, in their current incarnation, is dubious.</p>\n<p>The new implementation sees these two features being moved mainly from the main library (libgixsql) to the database driver libraries (e.g. libgixsql-pgsql), with only a few parameters passed around. The rationale behind this move is that different DBMSs behave in different ways, and trying to keep a unified approach would only lead to confusion (and bugs, a lot of bugs). What follows is the level of support planned for the various DB drivers.</p>\n<h4>Autocommit</h4>\n<p>Autocommit will basically work in three different modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Native: the connection will start in the default mode used by the database</li>\n<li>On: a <code>COMMIT </code>will be executed after each successful statement</li>\n<li>Off: the connection will start by opening a transaction. A new connection will be started after each <code>COMMIT </code>and <code>ROLLBACK</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Driver notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MySQL and ODBC (through its own drivers) directly support autocommit to be turned on or off, so the handling of this feature will be passed entirely to the native driver (e.g. libmysqlclient)</li>\n<li>Oracle has no concept of autocommit, just as PostgreSQL, but the first one always work in transaction mode, while transactions must be explicitly started in PostgreSQL. While autocommit (or \"transaction mode\" in the case of PostgreSQL) have been - and will further be - tested, these differences (and the ones above) can probably lead to different behaviours when switching a single codebase that makes heavy use of the autocommit feature to a different DB, if precautions are not taken and tests performed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Updatable cursors</h4>\n<p>Updatable cursors will allow the update/deletion of a single cursor row after a fetch, using the clause <code>UPDATE...WHERE CURRENT OF mycursor </code>after a cursor has been opened <code>FOR UPDATE</code>.</p>\n<p>Driver notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oracle directly supports updatable cursors, so the handling of this feature will be passed entirely to the native driver.</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL directly supports updatable cursors when native cursors are enabled - this is the default - in the GixSQL driver (libgixsql-pgsql); in this case the handling of this feature will be passed entirely to the native driver. If cursors are emulated in PostgreSQL, updatable cursors are not available.</li>\n<li>MySQL and SQLite have updatable cursor emulation: the table on which the cursor is opened must have a unique key that will be used for the update. This has been proven to work, but it is obviously (a lot) slower than native support.</li>\n<li>ODBC will defer updatable cursor handling to its own drivers: it depends on them whether updatable cursors will be available or not. As a side note the ODBC driver for MySQL (MySQL Connector/ODBC) uses the same technique illustrated above to emulate updatable cursors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this is the focus of what will be v1.0.19 (some prereleases will surely be published before that) there will be the usual amount of bug fixes and, where possible, smaller features.</p>",

While this means that an Internet connection is needed to install Gix-IDE <em>with</em> a compiler, it makes the installer a lot smaller and more easily upgradable. As a consequence, there are no more \"no-compilers\" packages, you just will just have to skip installing the compiler(s) when running the installer.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Windows binary packages have been signed with my code-signing certificate, for an added level of trust.</p>\n<p>There is a brand-new package for Ubuntu 22.04, that should avoid the compatibility hacks that were needed for the previous package (aimed at 20.04). Debian-specific packages will follow as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Beware: this pre-release is to be considered of \"beta quality\": there are probably a few bugs - both in packaging and in the code itself - that have to be shaken down, and a few known issues (see below), but as development is gaining some traction, I really needed to streamline the process, and this (pre-)release is a step in that direction.</p>\n<p>Another point of attention is the fact that the new packages are being built with GitHub Actions: the building and packaging process is entirely reproducible using the workflows supplied in this repository. This also means that - internally - development has been moved almost entirely from a SVN-based setup to Git/GitHub: some long-term work will still take place internally (at first), but updates on GitHub will be quicker and more frequent.</p>\n<p>All of the above (building, packaging, etc.), starting from the next release, will also apply to GixSQL, for which I am doing some planning/research and hope to have a timeframe really soon.</p>\n<p>The packages are signed with my GPG private key.
