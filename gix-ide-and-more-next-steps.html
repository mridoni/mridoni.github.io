After that I will restart the work I began a couple of months ago and that involves a complete refactoring of the debugger. The debugger will be a separate module (actually two, at least on Windows, for x64 and x86) and the IDE will communicate with it through a well-defined protocol, that I intend to document (time-constraints permitting, of course). This will have important consequences:</p><ol><li>On Windows (and possibly on Linux) it will be possible to debug programs for a different (but obviously supported) architecture: in practice this means that on x64 Windows you will be able to debug both x64 and x86 programs from either version of the IDE, while at the moment you can only debug programs compiled for your host architecture (actually the architecture Gix-IDE was compiled for).</li><li>It will be possible to have remote debugging and it will be easier to implement an "attach and debug" feature</li><li>It will be possible to use the debugger to develop your own debugging client</li></ol><p>I am not promising that all these features will be present in the first major release (it will probably be named 1.1.x) but this is definitely the road ahead.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 30/12/2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fgix-ide-and-more-next-steps.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fgix-ide-and-more-next-steps.html&amp;via=%40quasicomese&amp;text=Gix-IDE%20(and%20more)%3A%20next%20steps" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmridoni.github.io%2Fgix-ide-and-more-next-steps.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span></a></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-107-is-coming.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Gix-IDE 1.0.7 is coming</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-107-is-behind-the-corner.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Gix-IDE 1.0.7 is behind the corner </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-01-11T17:17" class="feed__date">11/01/2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-107-is-behind-the-corner.html" class="invert">Gix-IDE 1.0.7 is behind the corner</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-12-30T14:24" class="feed__date">30/12/2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://mridoni.github.io/gix-ide-107-is-coming.html" class="invert">Gix-IDE 1.0.7 is coming</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://mridoni.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
